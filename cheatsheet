CHEAT SHEET

[p] : paragraph break. (More efficient than I7's native [paragraph break].
[br]: line break.


POPS
[pop N]: pick a random member from list N, and say it.
[uppop N]: pop, but capitalises the first letter.
[downpop N]: pop, but all lowercase.
[titlepop N]: pop, but with all words capitalised.
[noreppop N]: pop, but rejects a result if it has been noreppop'd before on this turn
[friendpop N]: for major NPCs, adding them to special lists. Mostly it'll be [friendpop NPCnames]


[*a]: Use before any [pop N] to get a/an.
[plure]: Use before any [pop], and put [s] or [*s] after it; will pluralise singular nouns.
[is-are]: says "is" or "are" depending on whether things are plural

[cutadj] and [backadj]: use on either side of a scent pop if you don't want it to sometimes include randomly-selected adjectives, like [cutadj][pop allbasicscents][backadj].

IRREGULAR PLURALS:

[reckon]: declares that a noun is its own plural ('sheep')
[*es] - > countess[es]
[*f] -> wol[f|ves]
[*ies] -> count[y|ies]
[*en] -> ox[en]
[*man] -> man/men; will eventually respect gender
[*ices] -> cod[ex|ices]
[*ix] -> aviatr[ix|ices]

(You can come up with your own, too.)

GENDERS:

(of NPCs mentioned in a memory)

[neut]: if gender is unestablished, set to a random gender
[fem]: if gender is unestablished, 90% chance of setting to female, 5% to male, 5% nonbinary
[masc]: if gender is unestablished, 90% chance of setting to male, 5% to female, 5% nonbinary

[their], [they], [them]: returns their/her/his, they/he/she, them/her/him, according to pre-established gender; if no gender is established, choose one at random.

MEMORY MANIPULATION:

[m N]: Add resonance list N to possible resonances. So if a memory evokes romance, [m romance]. See Targeted Resonances for possibilities.

[lover]: [m romance, [m lust], and tag lover-themed fragments at the end of the sentence

[theseason], [upseason]: Says the current season: if there isn't an established season already, choose one. upseason does the same, but returns Spring rather than spring.
[spring], [summer], [autumn], [winter]: says nothing, but sets the season manually.

[aproposadj], [aproposnoun]: These grab words from the current theme/s - so if the perfume is goth-themed, they might give you 'pale' and 'crow' respectively. Mostly good for naming things ("Crow House").

COMMONLY-USED LISTS:

NPCnames: names of characters (might be full names, surnames or forenames)
allsurnames: just surnames
histnames: names that work as names of historical eras (generally one-word)

Roles: a large list of personal nouns, including jobs (doctor, poet, admirer, subjectivist)

allbasicscents: every scent, except for weird hints and more complicated constructions. Consider bracketing with [cutadj] and [backadj] if you want the output to be a single word

colors: exciting colours! cornflower! sienna! indigo!
simpcolors: basic colours! red, black, green, grey

majorloc: major cities

regionals: nations and regions that a scent might come from
suitornats: national/cultural identity of NPCs; slightly different

namedplace: locates a memory in a named place, with a preposition: 'at the Blue Mosque'
didlocation: locates a memory in either a named or generic place ('in a Cairo makerspace')
