Abooting is an action applying to nothing. Understand "about" as abooting.
Instead of abooting:
	say "Made for Emily Short.[p]Heavy Petal, which does not exist, is Sam Kabo Ashwell, Yoon Ha Lee, Cat Manning, and Caleb Wilson.";

startroom is a room.

After printing the banner text:
	say "Update 0.1 [b]Jasmine[/b][p]";

[
UPDATE 0.1: JASMINE:
	* added basic, entirely-random resonances
	* added very specific menu-based choice
	* hunted out a bug that sometimes added scents to the notelist, and thus to options, without them appearing in the perfume description

Volume - I Can't Belive It's Not Tracery

[
This section is largely lifted from Apocalypse Fuel, and works along the same principles as Kate Compton's Tracery: lists which contain text strings, which might then refer to other lists, and so on.

In I7, this is done through the power of text subs. 'pop X' is the basic format, which means 'look through list X, pick a random entry, and say it.' Saying it may trigger more pops, and so on. There are variants of 'pop' for when you want slightly more specific behaviour:
	
* noreppop stores output to a list, and will not repeat entries from that list (the list empties after each player action).
* uppop and downpop change the case of the first letter in the resulting output.

Some pops are for specific kinds of thing:
	
* friendpop is for NPCs in memories. Right now it just adds their name to a list, 'clique', and does nothing further.
* scentpop is specifically for perfume notes: it stores the results in a distinct list, notelist, and does work adding adjectives.

Book - Scent Styles

[As a way of providing some unifying flavour - but not too much - to descriptions of scents, we have THEMES. Themes do several things:
	
1) Some scent notes are tagged as being related to themes. Appropriately-themed scent notes are slightly more likely to show up - the way this is done is imprecise and inefficient and might need reworking, alas.
2) Sometimes adds adjectives to the front of scent notes. This follows the general theming of the perfume, not of the scent note.
3) In some patterns, themes provide interstitial phrases from the 'composite' list, connecting scent notes - 'hawthorn | intertwines with | smoky oudh.'
4) For fantastical scent-notes formed as compound names, themes can provide nouns, as in 'bane|wood'.

Perfumes can have one or two themes.

Adding entirely new themes should be OK, but might be a fair amount of work; it should include tagging existing scent-notes.
]

A theme is a kind of thing.
A theme has a list of texts called the twist.
A theme has a list of texts called the composite.

The themelist is a list of things that varies.

[Chooses themes for a new perfume]

To themepick:
	now the themelist is {};
	let Z be the list of themes;
	sort Z in random order;
	add entry 1 in Z to the themelist;
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds, add entry 2 in Z to the themelist;
	[say the themelist;
	say ": ";]

[Sometimes inserts a thematic adjective in front of a scent note; probability may need tweaking]

To say thematic:
	[Thematics are not the only adjective]
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds begin;
	let X be the number of entries in the themelist;
	let XA be a random number between 1 and X;
	let N be entry XA in the themelist;
	let O be the twist of N;
	say "[noreppop O]";
	say " ";
	end if;
	
[Picks a thematic linking phrase to connect two scent-notes]

To say composes:
	let Z be the themelist;
	let F be the number of entries in Z;
	let FA be a random number from 1 to F;
	let X be entry FA in Z;
	let Q be the composite of X;
	[if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds, now Q is the generic composite list;]
	say "[pop Q]";

scent-themed is a truth-state that varies. scent-themed is false.

[Sometimes rejects and re-picks scent-notes if they don't match the theme;]

To say b (N - a theme):
	brand N;

To brand (N - a theme):
	if N is listed in the themelist, now scent-themed is true;
	
To decide whether shit is off-brand:
	if scent-themed is true, no;
	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds, no;
	yes.
	
[Scentpop and notepop are similar, except that scentpop adds thematic adjectives.

The trick here is that scentpop/notepop cannot be self-referential, or weird shit starts to happen - a scentpop can include other kinds of pops, but not scentpops. Failing to observe this will mess with the notelist.]

To say scentpop (N - a list of texts):
	now scent-themed is false;
	let X be the number of entries in N;
	let Q be a random number between 1 and X;
	let Z be entry Q of N;
	now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	while Z is listed in poplist or shit is off-brand begin;
		remove Z from notelist, if present;
		now Q is a random number between 1 and X;
		now Z is entry Q of N;
		now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	end while;
	add Z to poplist;
	add Z to notelist;
	say "[thematic][Z]";
	
To say notepop (N - a list of texts):
	let X be the number of entries in N;
	let Q be a random number between 1 and X;
	let Z be entry Q of N;
	now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	while Z is listed in poplist begin;
		remove Z from notelist, if present;
		now Q is a random number between 1 and X;
		now Z is entry Q of N;
		now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	end while;
	add Z to poplist;
	add Z to notelist;
	say "[Z]";

To say dject (N - a list of texts):
	if a random chance of 3 in 10 succeeds begin;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop N] ";
		say XY;
	otherwise if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	end if;
	
To say djectr:
	if a random chance of 1 in 6 succeeds begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	end if;

[
Adjpop is a pop specifically for perfume adjectives. It only fires some of the time, prints a space after itself, and is significantly less likely if there's already a thematic adjective. It also was horribly expensive at runtime, and has been replaced.

The table lookup drastically slows things down.

To say adjpop (N - some text):
	[if N is a scent listed in the Table of Bound Adjectives and a random chance of 3 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be the adjs entry;
		[if a random chance of 1 in 8 succeeds, now X is manyadjs;]
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	otherwise ]if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
		end if;]

Book - Scent Notes

[
TO ADD NOTES:
	* if they have a special list of adjectives, put it at the bottom and refer to it with 'dject mynewscentflav',
	* if not, put [djectr] in front unless you want to avoid generic adjectives
	* tag any suitable themes with [b themename]; this isn't a precise art and it's best to err on the side of inclusion.

A lot of scents are assigned fairly arbitrarily to top, heart or base notes; feel free to move them around or duplicate them if you have Opinions on this.

Chapter - Hints

[Hints are where all the Weird Scents go - a grab-bag of ingredients that aren't usually in perfume, and things that are more conceptual or evocative than precise ingredients. In general, scent patterns probably shouldn't have more than one hint. The list currently is pretty damn short.

There's potential for separate hints based on theme, but that can probably wait for if/when the list gets unwieldy.]

Volume - Reflective Choice

[This is vestigial thus far, and is the next big To Do item for getting the interactive part working: creating lists of things, and synonyms for things that scent-notes could come to symbolise, for the player. 

Once that's done, individual bits of memory can be tagged with general moods, which will be suggested to the player - so, if oudh appears in a fragment about the end of a relationship, it might suggest something like 'oudh stands for letting things die'. The suggestions will probably be wildly off at least some of the time - we're inviting the player to do some hand-sorting on our behalf, really.

Anyway, don't worry about this just yet.]

Naming NPCs thus far is a grab-bag of approaches, and I have yet to dial in how exactly I want to handle things; right now we have a mix of generated-then-cherry-picked conlang names, pseudo-Italian and Hellenic names, and (the only section with multi-word names) some fairly orthodox Anglo naming. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I'm not sure if the solution is More Things or a complete rethink.

(Yes, this is a wildly disproportionate amount of experimentation and effort spent on naming, but this is me.)

I have thus far held off from importing vast piles of name-generator stuff from other projects, partly because past experience has told me that trying to get name-gen patterns for every nation and culture is an effectively infinite task, and partly because I'm still not entirely sure what the success state looks like.

At some point there'll be a fuzzy system to infer NPC gender from forenames - in Apocalypse Fuel I dodged this question entirely and went with gender-neutral pronouns throughout, because genderfucky results are very Apocalypse World; here I would like names to agree with pronouns at least *some* of the time.

To say dramaname:
	say "[pop dramafores][one of][pop dramamids][or][purely at random][pop dramaafts]";

[Stolen direct from Apocalypse Fuel, dramaname produces Renaissance Italian-ish names, in the manner of Shakespeare pretending to be Boccaccio.]

[name3 takes English forenames, a prefix-suffix surname that can optionally go double-barreled with a more common surname; it can import forenames (and, once those exist, surnames?) from other naming styles. This is a better example of how a well-developed naming pattern should end up looking.]

[Name4 is roughly based on Persian phonology. Pure phonological generation produced a lot of tongue-bending monsters, so the current approach is to cherry-pick and use a list. If we stick with the phonology-procgen names (which I'm still not convinced about), it probably needs more regular structure - common suffixes, a surname system, that kind of thing.]
